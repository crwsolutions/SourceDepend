# Source Depend

A source generator for C# that uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (the C# compiler) which saves you from writing the DI code in your constructor.
These will be written during compile time.

[![NuGet version (sourcedepend)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/sourcedepend?color=blue)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sourcedepend/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/crwsolutions/sourcedepend.svg)](https://github.com/crwsolutions/sourcedepend/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

## How to use it

Install it and add an attribute to the fields you want be set in your constructor, like so:

```csharp
public partial class ExampleService
{
    [Dependency]
    private readonly AnotherService anotherService;

    public string GetValue() => anotherService.Value;
}
```

Because you constructor is highjacked, there is alternative method to do construction work

```csharp
public partial class ExampleService
{
    [Dependency]
    private readonly AnotherService anotherService;

    ///This method will be called after the field assignments
    partial void Construct() {
        anotherService.ConstructValue = "Hello from construct!";
    }

    public string GetValue() => anotherService.Value;
}
```
