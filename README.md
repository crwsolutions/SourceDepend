# Source Depend

A source generator for C# that uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (the C# compiler) which saves you from writing the DI plumming in your constructor.
These will be written during compile time.

So you do not have to write code like this, bacause it is generated:

```csharp
public partial class ExampleService
{
    public ExampleService(ConsoleApp.IAnotherService anotherService)
    {
        this.anotherService = anotherService;
    }
}
```

## How to use it

Install it and add an attribute to the fields and properties you want be set in your constructor, like so:

```csharp
public partial class ExampleService
{
    [Dependency]
    private readonly AnotherService anotherService;

    [Dependency]
    AnotherService Prop { get; }
}
```

It is also possible that the generated assignment is to an anternative property

```csharp
public partial class ExampleService
{
    [Dependency(nameof(BindingContext))]
    AnotherService ViewModel => BindingContext as AnotherService;
}
```

Because you constructor is highjacked, there are the alternative methods PreConstruct/PostConstruct to do your construction work

```csharp
public partial class ExampleService
{
    [Dependency]
    private readonly AnotherService anotherService;

    ///This method will be called before the generated assignments
    partial void PreConstruct()
    {
        Initialize()
    }

    ///This method will be called after the generated assignments
    partial void PostConstruct() => anotherService.ConstructValue = "Hello from post-construct!";
}
```

These samples give combined the following generated code:

```csharp
namespace ConsoleApp
{
    public partial class ExampleService
    {
        public ExampleService(ConsoleApp.IAnotherService anotherService, ConsoleApp.AnotherService prop, ConsoleApp.AnotherService viewModel)
        {
            PreConstruct();

            this.anotherService = anotherService;
            Prop = prop;
            BindingContext = viewModel;

            PostConstruct();
        }

        partial void PreConstruct();
        partial void PostConstruct();
    }
}
```
